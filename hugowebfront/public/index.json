In this workshop you will learn how to deploy Fortinet\u0026rsquo;s FortiGate NGFW on Azure in several different use cases\nLearning Objectives Learn thing 1 Learn thing 2 Learn thing 3 About TEChnical Recipes Launch Now\nClicking the Launch Now button opens the Github Actions tab, click the \u0026ldquo;Run Workflow\u0026rdquo; button on the right-hand side, enter your email address and click the lower \u0026ldquo;Run Workflow\u0026rdquo; button.\nThe workflow starts the TEChnical Recipe environment provisioning process. An email is sent to the provided email address when the environment provisioning process is complete. The email contains environment details, including all required access credentials and links, as well as environment duration period. When the environment duration period has passed the environment and all resources will be removed.\nTEChnical Recipes provide the learner with the opportunity to put into practice newly developed skills in an easy to launch environment that can be used for customer engagements. At a minimum a TEChnical Recipe will include the following:\nA use case description\nAn integrated lab and demo environment\nInformational call-outs for key points to discuss or highlight to a customer Questions that could be asked while giving the TEChnical Recipe as a demo Points of value that relate the business value to the technical feature A reference architecture(s)\nOptional components may be included for certain use cases\nThe TEChnical Recipe will not be a completely, self-contained learning experience for a single product. A TEChnical Recipe will cover features and often multiple products where they relate to the use case of interest.\nDeployments will be automated for those tasks that are not salient to the learning or demonstration activity in the use case. For example, for a TEChnical Recipe focused on Indicators of Compromise, the system may deploy a FortiGate and FortiAnalyzer with configurations for these systems. However, the leaner will have to configure the Event Handlers for IOC setup.\nAzure SDWAN TEChnical Recipe Introduction: As enterprises adopt the cloud as the new core for application hosting, remote sites require secure, reliable connectivity with an optimal user experience to access those cloud and SaaS applications. In fact, cloud access is SD-WAN\u0026rsquo;s primary use case for IaaS and SaaS-hosted services. Fortinet\u0026rsquo;s Cloud On-Ramp capabilities using SD-WAN are differentiated in the following ways:\nIntegrated Security and SD-WAN policy configuration and workflows Unique ability to provide scale up performance for higher bandwidth into cloud environments Decentralized orchestration for better survivability and easier deployment of SD-WAN overlays Single OS for consistent policy and overlay deployment on all software-defined networks (SDNs) The purpose of this TEChnical Recipe is to familiarize the learner with routing, data-plane, and architectural concepts specific to the Azure Cloud environment. Other TEChnical Recipes are available to cover SD-WAN feature deployment.\nTEChnical Recipe Main Objectives Deploy the SDWAN architecture using Terraform Configure Azure components Load Balancer VNET Peering Route Server vWAN and vWAN Hub Understand the different available architecture options "

Only after a failover event will the newly active FortiGate start responding to health probes. Why is NAT used to access the FortiGates, but for IPSEC VPN traffic Load balancing rules are used?\nNAT allows each individual FortiGate to be accessed via the Public IP of the load balancer. A load balancer rule would only allow access to the Active FortiGate.

Terraform Providers are available for FortiGate and FortiManager to insert and iterate running configuration.\nFor more information, review the following:\nFortiOS 7.2 Admin Guide\nTerraform Providers\nKey questions during your demo - Chapter 1 When giving this TEChnical Recipe as as demo, the following questions will provide a basis for next steps and future meetings:\nHas your organization standardized on an IaC tool-set for infrastructure provisioning and iteration? How are the responsibilities for infrastructure assigned? Does cloud network fall under a DevOps, Cloud Networking, or Application Delivery team, as examples? What is view on how IaC can improve workflows? Is workflow automation in cloud and cross-organizational collaboration important within your cloud business? "

	"content": " Discussion Points During a Dem - Chapter 2 When discussing load balanced traffic with the customer, point out key details about the Azure Load Balancers such as the following:\nAzure LB uses 5-tuple hash for traffic distribution IPSec in an Active/Active configuration is not supported as session stability cannot be guaranteed to IkE rekeys, and deterministic IP termination. TCP/UDP headers are rewritten to the backend pool. HTTP/s headers are not changed. Legacy applications or those requiring long-lived sessions could see performance issues due to TTL limitations on the LB. When connecting IPSec traffic from remote inter-regional sites, the customer\u0026rsquo;s architecture could benefit from dedicated FortiGates to support IPSec. This is a benefit where large traffic loads are supported for deep packet inspection and where there is a lot of E/W traffic. Dedicated FortiGates for IPSec allow the opportunity to scale VPN traffic using IPSec Aggregate without impacting performance of traffic inspection. Details on IPSec Aggregate can be found here.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t forget that the CLI is still a great place to get targeted information with a single command. For example, viewing the FortiGate known routes with the CLI command get router info routing-table all\nKey questions during your demo - Chapter 2 When giving this TEChnical Recipe as as demo, the following questions will provide a basis for next steps and future meetings:\nHow sensitive are your applications to session timeout? Do they require large TTL values for long-lived sessions? What type of VPN scaling (tunnel count and bandwidth) are required for your deployment? How much east/west traffic versus north/south traffic will be supported? What types of inspection will be required between various VNets? Is advanced BGP configuration required? (FortiGate-to-FortiGate can support advanced BGP metrics unlike Azure\u0026rsquo;s services) "
